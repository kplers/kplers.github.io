## 문제

**난이도: Medium**

You are given a positive integer array `skill` of even length `n` where `skill[i]` denotes the skill of the `i`th player. Divide the players into `n / 2` teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.

The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.

Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return `-1` if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

### Example 1:

**Input:** `skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]`  
**Output:** `22`  
**Explanation:**  
Divide the players into the following teams: `(1, 5)`, `(2, 4)`, `(3, 3)`, where each team has a total skill of 6.  
The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: `1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22`.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `skill = [3,4]`  
**Output:** `12`  
**Explanation:**  
The two players form a team with a total skill of 7.  
The chemistry of the team is `3 * 4 = 12`.

### Example 3:

**Input:** `skill = [1,1,2,3]`  
**Output:** `-1`  
**Explanation:**  
There is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

### Constraints:

- `2 <= skill.length <= 10^5`
- `skill.length` is even.
- `1 <= skill[i] <= 1000`

## 풀이

```python
from collections import defaultdict
class Solution:
    def dividePlayers(self, skill: List[int]) -> int:
        # first get the sum
        skill_sum=sum(skill)
        team_sum:int=skill_sum//(len(skill)//2)
        how_many=defaultdict(int)
        chemistry=0
        # construct how_many
        for score in skill:
            how_many[score]+=1
        
        # calculating the answer
        for number in how_many:
            if how_many[number]==how_many[team_sum-number]:
                chemistry+=number*(team_sum-number)*how_many[number]
            else:
                return -1
        return chemistry//2
```
